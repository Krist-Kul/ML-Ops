# ITCS355 Lab 1 — training image
#
# Base pinned BY DIGEST, not by tag. Tags move: `python:3.11-slim` today is not
# `python:3.11-slim` next month, and a moving base is the commonest reason a
# "reproducible" build stops reproducing. This is the multi-arch index digest, so the
# same line resolves correctly on amd64 and arm64 while still naming exact bytes.
# Refresh it deliberately with:
#     docker buildx imagetools inspect python:3.11-slim
